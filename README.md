# VotsEngine - Decentralized Voting System

A comprehensive blockchain-based voting system built on Ethereum that ensures transparent, secure, and tamper-proof elections with NFT tokenization.

## üöÄ Overview

VotsEngine is a **proof of concept** smart contract-based voting platform that mirrors traditional voting systems while adding blockchain transparency and security. The system tokenizes elections and provides a complete end-to-end voting solution with external verification capabilities.

This proof of concept demonstrates how traditional electoral processes can be enhanced with blockchain technology, featuring integration with Chainlink Functions for off-chain voter data verification through external APIs. The current implementation connects to a sandbox environment of a verification provider's API to validate voter credentials.

The election model mirrors traditional systems in that it has both **polling officers** and **polling units**. They are both expected to be **physical locations with physical computers customized to perform these operations**. The system **reduces the number of trust points (interception points)** that traditional election systems are attacked from. There is also **instant results when the election ends**.

The system consists of multiple integrated contracts:

- **VotsEngine**: Core contract that manages election creation and acts as a factory
- **Election**: Individual election contracts with comprehensive voting logic
- **VotsElectionNft**: NFT contract that mints commemorative tokens for election creators
- **VotsEngineFunctionClient**: Handles external verification requests using Chainlink Functions

## üîó Chainlink Integration Files

The following files implement Chainlink Functions for external voter verification:

- **[VotsEngineFunctionClient.sol](src/VotsEngineFunctionClient.sol)** - Main Chainlink Functions client contract
- **[IVotsEngineFunctionClient.sol](src/interfaces/IVotsEngineFunctionClient.sol)** - Interface for the function client
- **[source.js](server/source.js)** - JavaScript code executed by Chainlink Functions
- **[upload-secrets-1.js](server/upload-secrets-1.js)** - Configuration for Chainlink Functions secrets

> **Note**: The system uses Chainlink Functions to connect with external APIs for voter verification in a sandbox environment.

### Interacting with the Live Contract

You can interact with the deployed contract using:

1. **Etherscan Interface**: Visit the contract on Sepolia Etherscan to read contract state
2. **Web3 Libraries**: Connect using ethers.js or web3.js
3. **Frontend Applications**: Build dApps that interact with the contract

```javascript
// Example using ethers.js with Sepolia
const sepoliaContractAddress = "0xBdAc4C73AdFF22977cA7C8E71D0cb49566147C41....";
const VotsEngineSepoliaClient = new ethers.Contract(sepoliaContractAddress, abi, sepoliaProvider);

// Example using ethers.js with Fuji
const fujiContractAddress = "0xed7eA5221041A1982d9d257c9617B1448032838d";
const VotsEngineFujiClient = new ethers.Contract(fujiContractAddress, abi, fujiProvider);

// Get total elections count
const totalElections = await VotsEngineSepoliaClient.getTotalElectionsCount();
```

## üìñ Usage

### Physical Infrastructure Requirements

The VotsEngine system requires a **hybrid physical-digital infrastructure**:

- **Polling Officers**: Stationed at physical locations with customized computers for voter accreditation
- **Polling Units**: Separate physical locations with specialized hardware for vote casting
- **Customized Hardware**: Dedicated computers configured specifically for election operations
- **Secure Network**: Reliable internet connectivity at all polling locations
- **Physical Security**: Standard election security measures at all designated locations

### Deploying the System

The VotsEngine is already deployed on multiple testnets:
- **Sepolia**: `0xBdAc4C73AdFF22977cA7C8E71D0cb49566147C41....`
- **Fuji (Avalanche)**: `0xed7eA5221041A1982d9d257c9617B1448032838d`

For local development or custom deployments:
```solidity
// Deploy the complete system
VotsElectionNft nftContract = new VotsElectionNft();
CreateElection electionCreator = new CreateElection();
VotsEngine votsEngine = new VotsEngine(address(electionCreator), address(nftContract));
```

Or connect to the existing deployments:
```javascript
// Connect to Sepolia deployment
const VotsEngineSepoliaClient = new ethers.Contract(
    "0xBdAc4C73AdFF22977cA7C8E71D0cb49566147C41....", 
    VotsEngineABI, 
    sepoliaProvider
);

// Connect to Fuji deployment
const VotsEngineFujiClient = new ethers.Contract(
    "0xed7eA5221041A1982d9d257c9617B1448032838d", 
    VotsEngineABI, 
    fujiProvider
);
```

### Creating an Election

When you create an election, you automatically receive an NFT as proof of ownership:

```solidity
// Prepare election parameters
IElection.ElectionParams memory params = IElection.ElectionParams({
    startTimeStamp: startTimestamp,
    endTimeStamp: endTimestamp,
    electionName: "Student Union Election 2024",
    description: "Annual student union election for leadership positions",
    candidates: candidates,
    voters: voters,
    pollingUnits: pollingUnits,
    pollingOfficers: pollingOfficers,
    categories: categories
});

// Create election (NFT is automatically minted to msg.sender)
VotsEngine.createElection(params);
```

### External Verification Integration

The system supports external verification through Chainlink Functions, demonstrating how traditional voter validation can be integrated with blockchain systems:

```solidity
// Send verification request for voter (connects to sandbox API)
bytes32 requestId = VotsEngine.sendVerificationRequestForElection(
    ninNumber,        // National ID number
    firstName,        // Voter's first name
    lastName,         // Voter's last name
    voterMatricNo,    // Voter's matriculation number
    slotId,          // Chainlink Functions slot ID
    version,         // Chainlink Functions version
    electionTokenId, // Election token ID
    subscriptionId   // Chainlink subscription ID
);
```

**Note**: The current implementation uses a sandbox environment for API verification, making it suitable for testing and demonstration purposes.

For detailed Chainlink Functions setup, see the [Chainlink integration files](#üîó-chainlink-integration-files) listed above.

### Voting Process

1. **Accredit Voter** (Polling Officer at physical location):
```solidity
VotsEngine.accrediteVoter("MAT001", electionTokenId);
```

2. **Cast Vote** (Polling Unit at designated physical location):
```solidity
IElection.CandidateInfoDTO[] memory votes = [
    IElection.CandidateInfoDTO("Alice Johnson", "CAN001", "President")
];
VotsEngine.voteCandidates("MAT001", "John Doe", votes, electionTokenId);
```

3. **Get Instant Results** (Available immediately when election ends):
```solidity
IElection.ElectionWinner[][] memory winners = VotsEngine.getEachCategoryWinner(electionTokenId);
```

- Polling units at designated locations can only process votes
- Addresses cannot have multiple roles

### Validation
- Comprehensive input validation
- Duplicate prevention mechanisms
- State-based operation restrictions
- Time-based access controls
- External verification integration

### Transparency
- All operations emit events
- Immutable vote records
- Public result verification
- Open-source smart contracts
- NFT proof of election creation
- Instant result availability eliminates delayed reporting vulnerabilities
